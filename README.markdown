UNVPK
=====
Unvpk is a small command line tool for listing, checking and extracting of VPK
archives. Such archives are used in Steam engine based games like Portal 2.

Notes
-----
This program is written by Mathias Panzenb√∂ck and released under the LGPL v2.1.
However, I looked at the source of Gibbeds VPK Extractor in order to find out
how VPK works.
